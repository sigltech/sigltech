- 👋 Hi, I’m @sigltech
- 👀 I’m interested in Front-end and full-stack developer roles!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, honing in my React and Flask development with a bug Tracker that uses React for the front end with Tailwind CSS, A Node server hosted on render.com and a mongoDB server using Mongoose, hosted on Mongo Atlas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any C# projects as I try to develop my skills in areas i'm less confident!
- 📫 How to reach me: reach me through richardoskar00@gmail.com
