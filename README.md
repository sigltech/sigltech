- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sigltech
- I'm  full-stack engineer, working at Unity with a current focus on backend development
- Technologies I work with on a daily:
    - React
    - Kotlin
    - C#
    - .Net
    - Golang
- Things I like that aren't code:
    - Dogs

    - The need to constantly work on a new project (well, I at least got 3 hobbies in before this)
